## 📝 Learning Notes

### Session 1 (2026-02-17)

- Completed Chapter 1: The DSA Mindset
- Learned: 3 core smells (recalculation, search, ordering)
- Smell Test: 3.5/5 — missed topo sort trigger, confused two pointers with running state
- Brute Force Drill: 3/5 — need to sharpen pairs vs subsets distinction
- Started Chapter 2: The Universal Checklist (5-step system)
- Completed first checklist application (longest subarray with sum ≤ K)
- Java coding exercise pending: SlidingWindowLongestSubarray.java
- **Random revision system activated** — pop quizzes from past topics

### Session 2 (2026-02-25)

- Completed Chapter 3: Pattern Recognition System (Drill Score: 3.4/5)
- Completed Chapter 4: Complexity & Constraint Intuition
- Completed Chapter 5: Arrays & Strings (5 core patterns)
- Coded 5 array problems in Java (Kadane's, Dutch Flag, Cyclic Sort, Prefix Sum, In-Place)
- **Weakness identified**: Topological Sort ("dependencies" trigger) and Constraint table

**Next Session**: Chapter 6 - Sliding Window Deep Dive
